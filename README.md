# Grid-dashboard

## Description of the project

For this project i had to build an entire static webpage, without functionality, only using grid properties in CSS, recreating a page layout similar to [This one](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/43cc6ab69fdfbef40d431a65677d2144668930ac/intermediate_html_css/grid/project_admin_dashboard/imgs/dashboard-project.png).

This project is part of the THE ODIN PROJECT course.

## Struggles points
I had many struggles during this project. It took me a while to realize what initial layout (the first grid) I was going to use, so I decided to first build a simple layout and then developing sections one by one. Doing that i had the chance to know and to use better the grid system but I still feel unsecure using them cause i had many struggles regarding the scalability of every element, the dimensions of parent containers and items contained in them, how a grid grows autamtically and, last but not least, measuring units. For my project i mainly used pixels and fr. I personally think that fr need to be used in internal layout of the page and px need to be used for specific items.

## Conclusions
At the end of this project i feel much more confident using grids but i feel that I still need a lot more practice with those, maybe I'll analyze properties one by one in smaller areas rathern than build an entire webpage with those, to see how every container and every item interact with those. I had fun using icons and setting a general colors palette for the entire page. Overall I'm pretty confident to have done a good job respecting all the instructions provided by the course.
